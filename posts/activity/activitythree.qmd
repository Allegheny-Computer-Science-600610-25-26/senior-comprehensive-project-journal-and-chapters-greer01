Outline and Justifications for Chapter Two: Related Work

Title: Chapter Two: Related Work

The second chapter of my senior thesis will look at and synthesize the academic literature that completes CaddySense. The goal is not only to cite prior work, but to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how those works connect in the regards of highlighting gaps, contradictions, and other things like opportunities that motivate this project.

Outline of Chapter Two:

2.1 Overview of AI in Sports
- Summarizes major trends when applying AI to athletic performance (predictive modeling, video analysis, feedback systems).
- Discusses early AI systems like the ones that were reviewed by 'Baca' (2013) and compare them to today's advanced systems like Zhou (2025).

2.2 Personalized Training and Coaching Systems
- Examines how AI driven tools are able to give personalized feedback, such as 'Plan fitting' (2023) and 'AI in Digital Sports Coaching' (2024).
- Identifies the strengths for things like real time adaptability, and data insights, and weaknesses like privacy concerns, or lack of user context.
- Explains how CaddySense is able to extend these ideas through things like conversational AI in local data.

2.3 Ai Models and Performance Metrics
- Reviews studies that are defining key performance indicators in sports analytics (driving distance, GIR%, and putting accuracy).
- Connects how these metrics are translated into computational models along with training feedback systems.
- Cites works like 'Baladaniya' (2025) and 'Abade' (2024) for sports performance and optimization.

2.4 User Trust and AI Interaction
- Discusses the research on user trust and acceptance of AI in coaching using (Wachholz, 2025).
- Explores how conversations AI in certain models can improve engagement compared to other feedback dashboards.

2.5 Ethical and Societal Context
- Summarizes literature which addresses the fairness, accessibility, and the bias in the world of AI coaching tools. 
- Discusses how CaddySense contributes when it comes to transparent and user controlled AI, which is explained with the work of 'Gao' (2024), and 'Majedi (2024).

2.6 Summary and Research Gap
- Highlights the major limitations when it comes to current research works like the lack of personalized systems for recreational athletes.
- Positions CaddySense as a bridge between both sports analytics and personal AI assistance.


Justifications
This outline make sure that the requirements are reached by:
- Making the connected discussions known, rather than just a list of summaries
- Making note of 16 sources, and using them in the writing to support ideas and research.
- Demonstrating the engagement when comparing, contrasting, and seeing the gaps in specific research.
- Providing the main grounds for later chapters.

Some visuals seen in this chapter may include: 
- A comparison of how prior AI systems look at studies, approaches, limitations, and contributions.
- A diagram that maps out where CaddySense fits into the AI in sports world.
