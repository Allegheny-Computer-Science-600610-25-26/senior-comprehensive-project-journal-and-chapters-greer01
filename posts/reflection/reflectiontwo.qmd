## Reflecting on My Presentation Experience

Title: CaddySense: AI-Powered Golf Performance Assistant

Giving the presentation for my senior comp project I saw as both challenging and exciting. One of the main goals that I had when tackling this presentation was to have a strong, yet engaging presentation for the audience. I think that since my project was built around a new, and upcoming topic (AI), this would not be that difficult to accomplish.

I structured my presentation around a more narrative-like approach. I looked at how the data became in insight, and how that insight helps golfers improve at their game. This approach helped me guide the audience from the problem of how golfers do not really know which parts of their game mattered most, to the solution, my tool (CaddySense) and how it provides tailored, data backed feedback.

During this process, my first reader and I talked a lot about the approach, some of things I was encouraged to add were:

- adding a related works section that situated my project to other sports related AI studies.
- To expand some of my slides and split part important things to highlight them in a more detailed manner.
- Present my plots in individual slides in order to connect them both directly, and show how they differ at the same time.
- Frame my tool as a prototype for a future AI-powered app, not just as a console based program to make it feel more completed.

These things really compelled me to refine my presentation and made it feel a lot more put together in order to really tell a story about my project. For example specifically, the histogram of driving distances was not just a chart, it is a visual of player consistency that directly influences the course recommendation type.

The biggest thing that I took away from my presentation experience was how important it was to be clear and straightforward about what the tool is, and why it is important. I learned how to translate the code and data structures and present them in a way that people would understand without knowing everything about your tool and project.
